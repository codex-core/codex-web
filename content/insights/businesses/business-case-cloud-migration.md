### ROI Calculation Methods

**Traditional ROI Formula**
```
ROI = (Financial Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100
```

**Net Present Value (NPV)**
Consider the time value of money over a 3-5 year period:
```
NPV = Σ [Cash Flow / (1 + Discount Rate)^n]
```

**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
Compare 3-5 year costs of current infrastructure vs. cloud:
- Include all direct and indirect costs
- Factor in growth projections
- Account for technology refresh cycles
- Consider compliance and security investments
